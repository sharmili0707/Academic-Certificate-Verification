# Academic-Certificate-Verification
A Java-based certificate verification system that validates academic certificates using a secure file-based record system. The program reads certificate data from a CSV file and allows users (students, HRs, or organizations) to verify the authenticity of a certificate by entering its ID and candidate name.
